Evian1k’s Chill Code License (ECCL)

Copyright (c) 2025 Evian1k

Hey, so you found my Job Finder App—nice! I, Evian1k, made this thing from scratch (well, mostly), and I’m cool with you messing around with it under these rules:

1. You can use this code, tweak it, or share it—BUT only for fun, personal stuff, or learning. No making money off it unless I say okay first.
2. Give me a shoutout—put “Made by Evian1k” or link back to this license somewhere if you use it. Don’t act like you built it from the ground up.
3. Don’t sue me if it breaks your computer or makes your cat mad—this is “as is,” no promises it even works half the time.
4. If you wanna sell it or stick it in something commercial, hit me up (find me where you got this, probably). We’ll figure it out.
5. Share your changes if you want—would be dope to see what you do with it, but no pressure.

That’s it! Use it, enjoy it, don’t be a jerk about it. Questions? Hunt me down—Evian1k’s not hard to find if you’re looking.

Peace out!
